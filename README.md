# Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI)

## Problem Overview
Air pollution monitoring is critical for public health and policy-making. This project builds an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using environmental data.

## Data Source
Environmental and air quality data collected from public sources (pollutant levels, weather conditions, etc.).

## Models Used
Multiple regression models were trained and compared, including:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost (or any third model)

The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Streamlit

## How to Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
